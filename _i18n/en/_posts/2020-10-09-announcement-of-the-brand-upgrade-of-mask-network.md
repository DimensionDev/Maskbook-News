Dear Fellow Cyber Citizen，

We have launched our project with the name “Maskbook” in July 2018. Today, we are excited to announce that our brand name will be changed from “Maskbook” to **“Mask Network”**, effective as of October 9, 2020. The name change is the result of a rebranding effort designed to reflect the progress we have achieved and the wide spectrum of services we have delivered to our users.

In the last two years, we have been committed to helping our users take back control of their data and financial autonomy through encryption technology. As a result of this endeavor, **Maskbook** has grown into an iconic multinational brand and has winned widespread support from users all over the world.

Nevertheless, our business has undergone a tremendous shift recently and we have integrated functions such as decentralized social networking, borderless payment network, decentralized file storage and sharing, etc, and at this stage, we believe it is time for a change. Our new identity, **Mask Network**, not only reflects the core values that our current brand stood for, but also represents an evolution from our previous knowledge, heritage and roots and demonstrates our determination to realize our goal of connecting more users to the new, open Internet. In brief, by moving from Maskbook to **Mask Network**, we would like to make a statement to be perceived as a bellwether for the decentralized web community.

Once this change comes into effect, you will start seeing the new name **Mask Network** in our websites, marketing materials, and the services we offered.

— Starting from October 9, 2020, Mask Network will use a new domain name, from [maskbook.com](http://maskbook.com/) to [mask.io](http://mask.io/).

— The new version of LOGO will be updated. Mask Network will retain the original colour and “smiley face” elements while the text content will be changed from “Maskbook” to “Mask”.

We would love to reiterate that the name change will not involve any modifications to the nature and value of the company, nor will it in any way affect our current relationship with our users and business partners.

May we take this opportunity to thank you for your continued support. We look forward to bringing more innovative features and exciting experiences to you with this new branding.

Yours sincerely,

Mask Network
