While summer is approaching, let us reunite in the name of the Internet! This weekend (5.30-5.31), CAC is ready to reopen with the very first Internet Yami-Ichi. It is the very first Internet Yami-Ichi organized in China, and is our first off-line activity in 2020!

Internet Yami-Ichi is conceived as a flea market in which you can share and trade internet-related things in real life. In this strange market, you can browse many booths and find fantastic, eccentric objects and thoughts - Internet icon masks, an e-mail inbox overrun by spam, online fortune-telling, a data switch machine, online blind dating, HTML game, virtual fashion, music plugin, social phobia tags, etc.

Every cloud has a silver lining. Now, shut down your computer, bring all the bizarre bao beis, or go find them! All at the Internet Yami-Ichi @Chronus Art Center.

**WHAT IS INTERNETYAMI-ICHI**

The Internet Yami-Ichi, from the Japanese “Internet Black Market”, but also“sickness” and “addiction”, is a flea market where people consumed by theInternet can share and buy Internet-related things in real life. In this weird market, you can browse through the booths and find the amazing and the useless—in an ironic and humorous atmosphere reminiscent of the early Internet era. The Internet Yami-Ichi is also an art project that aims to materialize the virtual Internet through a performative fleamarket.

The Internet Yami-Ichi was created by the art collective IDPW, “a secret society on the Internet that goes back more than100 years,” and took place for the first time in Tokyo, in 2012. Since then many editions have been organized in several cities including New York, Seoul, Moscow, Madrid, Berlin， and more.
