DWeb Shanghai is a branch of the global DWeb. The goal is to bring together local developers, designers, travelers, musicians, mathematicians, or any like-minded people who have their thinking about the existing Internet and work together towards a better Internet.

Now the Internet is no longer a free and open place. More and more services are monopolized by giants. We no longer have our privacy. As our relationship with the Internet becomes closer and closer, we also gradually lose almost all our rights. To this end, we ，together with DWeb in various countries and cities around the world, want to put forward our ideas to change this situation, and strive to achieve. What decentralization brings to us is secure. The distributed storage of data on servers around the world can help us effectively prevent Internet giants from controlling us. A new decentralized network will give users unprecedented Rights and tools to protect your privacy data from being violated.

Our mission is to listen to everyone's voices, and use our technology to help realize your ideas and suggestions for the existing Internet, and pass such voices to more people to build the real Internet in our minds.
