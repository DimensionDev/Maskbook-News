**Part 1: Problem Description**

[Minds](https://www.minds.com/) is an alt-tech blockchain-based social network. Users can earn money or cryptocurrency for using Minds, and tokens can be used to boost their posts or crowdfund other users. Minds has been described as more privacy-focused than mainstream social media networks. (source: Wikipedia)

We are cooperating with Minds and our goal is to integrate the entire function into Minds so that the existing Minds users can use the same functionality and interface as we have in Twitter and Facebook, including the encryption & decryption and the plugin execution environment.

We are expecting developers to have a strong knowledge in what Mask Network can do so please do research before applying. Thank you.

2: **Enhance the File Service with ArDrive.io**

[https://github.com/DimensionDev/Maskbook/issues/2362](https://github.com/DimensionDev/Maskbook/issues/2362 "https://github.com/DimensionDev/Maskbook/issues/2362")

**_Platform:_** _Gitcoin_

**_Experience:_** _Intermediate_

**_Category:_** _Mask Plugin_

**_Time Commitment:_** _4 weeks_

**_Bounty Size:_** _2000 USD_

**Part 1: Problem Description**

[ArDrive](https://ardrive.io/) is a suite of file sync apps that let users pay once to store their data forever on Arweave. Our web and desktop apps focus on the core features of file sync like uploading and downloading, while giving the best security for private files and integrating with Arweave wallets for payments.

Mask Network is a browser extension that allows users to create encrypted posts and choose who is able to decrypt. Built upon this access control system and the capability of injecting any DOM elements into any social media, Mask Network creates an open market that welcomes everyone to create their own Dapplet or plugin on their favorite platforms.

We need help bringing the gap between Web 2 apps and ArDrive. ArDrive-Connect gives other web applications a standard set of libraries and interfaces that lets them connect their app and users into the ArDrive. Applications that connect with ArDrive can give their users the ability to upload, download and share their files from the PermaWeb. We have partnered with Mask Network to deliver this capability in their social network applications, so their users can easily leverage the PermaWeb for file sharing.

**4: Replace Twitter Profile Header Photo with any Media Type**

[https://github.com/DimensionDev/Maskbook/issues/2236](https://github.com/DimensionDev/Maskbook/issues/2236 "https://github.com/DimensionDev/Maskbook/issues/2236")

**_Platform：_**_Gitcoin_

**_Experience：_**_Intermediate_

**_Category：_**_Mask Plugin_

**_Time Commitment：_**_2 Weeks_

**_Bounty Size：_**_1000 DAI_

**Part 1: Problem Description**

Inspired by Twitter user [@Prathkum](https://twitter.com/Prathkum/status/1345041164605513728), I think it’s worth adding something similar to our Mask Network users by enabling decorating your Twitter header with any media type, e.g., a gif, a video or even an html5 page. We would like you to explore a possible solution yourself, although I do have an idea in my mind. Please propose your idea here and I will share my thoughts with you in the end.

**3. Unlock the Imagination of Online Publication Directly on Twitter with Unlock Protocol**

[https://github.com/DimensionDev/Maskbook/issues/2363](https://github.com/DimensionDev/Maskbook/issues/2363 "https://github.com/DimensionDev/Maskbook/issues/2363")

**_Platform:_** _Gitcoin_

**_Experience:_** _Intermediate_

**_Category:_** _Mask Plugin_

**_Time Commitment:_** _4 Weeks_

**_Bounty Size:_** _2000 USD_

**Part 1: Problem Description**

Mask Network offers a browser extension which lets users create encrypted tweets where the content of the tweet can only be “viewed” by other Twitter users if they use the Mask Network browser extension. These tweets can include text, but also images.

[Unlock](https://unlock-protocol.com/) is a protocol for memberships which lets creators deploy a lock and sell access to this lock using the Ethereum blockchain. Locks can be added to websites, or applications in order to monetize them.

We are proposing an integration between Unlock and Mask Network where creators will be able to post encrypted tweets and put them “behind” a lock, so that only members of the lock are able to view their content. If viewers are not members, then, Mask Network would offer the ability to Unlock these memberships. In that scenario, Mask Network is a referrer and should earn UDT.

For a more detailed description, you can refer to [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18bG3NAbfFZ7ofUEtq1Rdjs29XM1HveQ9htZ7rvC8JGo/edit?usp=sharing).

**_Platform:_** _Gitcoin_

**_Experience:_** _Beginner_

**_Category:_** _Other_

**_Time Commitment:_** _15 Days_

**_Bounty Size:_** _500 DAI_

**Part 1: Problem Description**

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has announced a new research team called Bluesky on December 11, 2019, which was an initiative to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. On January 22, Bluesky released a 61-page review named <[Ecosystem Review](https://coywolf.media/file/coywolf/pdf/decentralized-social-ecosystem-review.pdf)> . This Review was an overview of the most viable decentralized social network protocols and apps.

With the sponsor of Mask Network, Fat Garage will launch the first bounty: Translating the Bluesky’s into Mandarin.

The whole translation will be processed on the Roamsearch.

**5. Clubhouse on top of Twitter**

**_Platform:_** _Gitcoin_

**_Experience:_** _Advanced_

**_Category:_** _Mask Plugin_

**_Time Commitment:_** _4 weeks_

**_Bounty Size:_** _2500 USD_

**Part 1: Problem Description**

[Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/) has gone viral on the Internet the past week, everywhere in the world. It shows the potential of a socialized audio-only chat room. The success of the Clubhouse is not simply relying on its core audio chat feature. It consists of quite a lot of tweaks and details on their design. Therefore, this bounty is not to copy it. Instead, we just want to show the potential of Mask Network, being a middle layer on the existing Internet, that can integrate an audio chat room directly on top of Twitter with minimal efforts.

The idea is to inject a chat room in a single tweet, where each person who sees it and have Mask Network installed can choose to join the room to listen to the discussion, or, raise their hand to speak. In another word, each tweet is a unique chat room, which is designed to be one, with the audio chat functionality. This plugin basically turns each RESTFUL tweet into a REAL TIME discussion. On top of a social media with enough social feature plus the access control system provided by Mask Network, I believe this would bring our users an alternative choice on the existing social media and it should also bring our (potential) developers more creativeness on how we can play with Mask Network.
