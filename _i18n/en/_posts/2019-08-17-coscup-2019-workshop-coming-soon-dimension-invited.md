**Activity description**

COSCUP is an annual seminar jointly promoted by the Taiwan Open Source Community. It originated in 2006 and is one of the important promoters of the Taiwan Free Software Movement (FOSSM).

The purpose of COSCUP is to provide a platform that connects open-source developers, users and promoters. I hope to promote free and open-source software (FLOSS) through an annual seminar.
