On September 20, 2019, Atrium Scale was successfully held in San Francisco. Dimension.im was invited to this event.

The guests attending this event included many well-known personalities such as Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, a16z partner Connie Chan, Accel partner Dan Levine, and NEA partner Rick Yang.

Dimension.im is very fortunate to stand out from the many outstanding investment applications and come to participate in this event and discuss and learn with celebrities in the industry. The content shared by the on-site guests has benefited a lot.
