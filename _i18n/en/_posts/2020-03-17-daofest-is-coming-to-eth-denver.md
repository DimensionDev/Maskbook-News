On February 13, 2020, DAOfest will be held at The Sports Castle, Denver CO. Dimension CEO Suji Yan will attend this event and bring you the latest progress of Maskbook.

DAOfest ([https://www.daofest.io/](https://www.daofest.io/ "https://www.daofest.io/")) focuses on advancing technology and applications and organizational decentralized governance on a global scale and has now expanded to more than a dozen cities around the world.

This event was hosted by Felipeduarte and Matoken, and also invited DAOstack founders Matan Field and Audrey Tang to give a speech. DAO global practitioners will gather here to communicate and explore.

The concept of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is proposed from the field of blockchain. It is an organization that can automatically and systematically operate without any human intervention. DAO can also be defined as an organizational system that maintains and maintains itself through smart contracts. Users can decide their future development direction by voting.
