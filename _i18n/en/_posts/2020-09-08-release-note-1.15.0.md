Maskbook 1.15.0 has been released. We hope that you will like this version.

## Feature: MetaMask Integration

Now you can connect MetaMask to Maskbook, so that Maskbook can request to call a wallet in MetaMask without requiring your wallet private key being imported to Maskbook. This offers you greater flexibility to manage cryptocurrency assets.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug which injects duplicate payloads into composition text area when composing a post.
- Fixed a bug which shows a useless request-for-permission prompt dialogue on mobile devices.
