At the 118th ECMA Meeting, Sujitech, LLC, together with Alibaba, Huawei, Dell, Sony, and MetaMask are announced to be the new member of ECMA. The six companies will participate in the work of TC39 and promote the development of JavaScript.

Sujitech, LLC is the equity company of Dimension. Since Sujitech becomes a new member of ECMA, we will work together with other Chinese companies such as Alibaba, Huawei, 360, and we want to bridge the Chinese developers and other excellent developers all over the world.

**What is ECMA?**

ECMA International is a [standards organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_organization) for information and communication systems.The organization was founded in 1961 to standardize computer systems in Europe. Membership is open to large and small companies worldwide that produce, market or develop computer or communication systems, and have interest and experience in the areas addressed by the group's technical

**What is the purpose of ECMA？**

Ecma aims to develop [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization) and [technical reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_report) to facilitate and standardize the use of information communication technology and consumer electronics; encourage the correct use of standards by influencing the environment in which they are applied; and publish these standards and reports in electronic and printed form.

Unlike national standardization bodies, Ecma is a membership-based organization.

Ecma has actively contributed to worldwide standardization in information technology and telecommunications. More than 400 Ecma Standards and 100 Technical Reportshave been published, more than 2/3 of which have also been adopted as international standards and/or technical reports.

**What is TC39? Who is included?**

TC39 means Technical Committee number 39. It’s part of ECMA。

**What is the main work of TC39?**

Develop ECMA Script standard, the process of standard generation, and implement。

**What is the standard process?**

**Consists of five steps：**

**STAGE 0** 

Any discussion, idea, change, or addition which has not yet been submitted as a formal proposal is considered to be a “strawman” proposal at Stage 0. Only members of TC39 can create these proposals,。

**STAGE 1** 

At Stage 1 a proposal is formalized and expected to address cross-cutting concerns, interactions with other proposals, and implementation concerns. Proposals in this stage identify a discrete problem and offer a concrete solution to that problem.

**STAGE 2** 

Proposals in Stage 2 should offer an initial draft of the specification.

At this point, it’s reasonable for implementers to begin experimenting with actual implementations in runtimes. The implementation could come in the form of a polyfill, user code that mangles the runtime into adhering to the proposal; an engine implementation, which natively provides support for the proposal; or it could be support by a build-time compiler like Babel.

**STAGE 3** 

Proposals in Stage 3 are candidate recommendations. At this advanced stage, the specification editor and designated reviewers must have signed off on the final specification. A Stage 3 proposal is unlikely to change beyond fixes to issues identified in the wild.

Implementors should have expressed interest in the proposal as well — a proposal without support from implementors is dead in the water. In practice, proposals move to this level with at least one browser implementation, a high-fidelity polyfill or when supported by a build-time transpiler like Babel.

**STAGE 4** 

Finally, proposals get to Stage 4 when there are at least two independent implementations that pass acceptance tests.

Proposals that make their way through to stage four will be included in the next revision of ECMAScript.
