**Guest: CEO Suji Yan**

**Topic: The future of encryption: data-new forms of labor**

\**![]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/uploads/13.3-3.jpg)Suji Yan pointed out that with the development of the times, the relationship between users and platforms is not equal. The platform uses its advantages to obtain user data and information to generate secondary benefits. In some aspects, users may also be subject to privacy violations. In the attempt, the method used was backward, ideal, and unrealistic. There was no perfect solution that fit the current era.

Suji Yan believes that encryption is not to change the rights of centralized Internet giants but to protect users' labor, assets, and rights. Other decentralized social platforms want to create a new platform from the outside to replace Facebook and build a new ecosystem. Maskbook chooses to build on Facebook so that it can not only compete with Facebook but also force Facebook to reform and achieve data. A revolution in privacy.

In the end, Suji Yan believes that more and more people will realize the value of data, and in the future, encryption will become a basic and rights tool that everyone can have.

Yisi Liu believes that data privacy is important and insecure. At present, our data is being collected and abused by various platforms. Equifax and WeChat data breaches all point to one thing: our privacy is being violated! After analyzing the existing solution problems, Yisi Liu proposed a new solution, namely, the privacy protection solution on social networks-Maskbook. Use a distributed identity to protect users' privacy. The specific performance is three points:

* The password pair is separated from the user's account
* Users can use the same password pair to participate in all services or products that support the password pair
* Eventually turned into a new social network

**Guest: PM Neruthes**

**Topic: Product origin and introduction of Maskbook**

\**![]({{ site.baseurl_root }}/uploads/13.5-2.jpg)**Maskbook mainly uses asymmetric encryption to protect users' posts on Facebook. When you encrypt with a private key, unless the other party has your public key, you cannot see the information you posted, including Facebook ( (Only a bunch of garbled characters can be seen in Facebook's database). In simple terms, data is your money, Facebook is the bank, and Maskbook is your safekeeping. You put your money in the safe and then hand the safe to the bank for safekeeping. In this way, the bank cannot use your money at will without your consent.

The last part is the interactive part of the event. The Maskbook team-taught guests on the spot to use Maskbook, and published encrypted information on Facebook through Maskbook, taking everyone into the magical world of encryption.
