**Intro**

The second part of the Mask public offering, the $MASK LBP will launch at 3:00pm UTC+0, Feb 24th and end at 3:00am UTC+0, Feb 26th, a total of 36 hours. We will use the Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) by Balancer to auction 4% of the total supply in order to derive and capture the true value of $MASK.

LBP (Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool) is a variance of dutch auction or reverse auction. It's price will drop if no one buys as time progresses. Please learn how it works before participating in LBP and stay within reasonable price ranges. Don‘t FOMO. Balancer changes the weight of its predetermined pool weight to push the price down if no participant is buying.

On why we choose LBP and other cases for LBP, please refer to following article：

**Step 1:** Prepare your regular wallet like MetaMask or WalletConnect. Any wallet supported by Balancer will work here.

**Step 2:** Go to $MASK LBP link after the LBP start

**Step 3:** Buy at a price that you are comfortable with.

**Reminder** 

1. Due to the mechanism of reverse auction, **DO NOT APE IN at the beginning, you will likely get REKT. Stay rational before any trade decisions.**
2. The default max slippage is **0.5%**. Set it higher if you are buying with a relatively large order.

**How to View Price**

**Step 1:** With the latest version of your Mask desktop browser extension ready, go to Twitter.com. 

**Step 2:** Put in $MASK or #MaskLBP. You will see the price chart.

* The chart will display nothing before the LBP starts. It will start to display $MASK price after the LBP starts. There will be a dotted line trending downwards, which represents the price movement if no one purchases. We’ve also put a notice right below that warns about the risk of buying at the very beginning.

How to Purchase

1. After the LBP starts at 3pm (GMT+0), click [https://balancer.exchange/#/swap](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap%E3%80%82) and you will enter a page like the Picture 1 below.
2. Press connect on the top right corner, choose a wallet as shown in Picture 2. We recommend MetaMask.

3\. After connecting your wallet, go back to the main page and select Asset.

* $MASK LBP is paired with $USDC
* Please make sure that you have enough $ETH to pay for gas in your wallet.
* If you choose other assets, Balancer will automatically convert to $USDC and then trade for $MASK. The additional step could cause high slippage and transaction fees.
