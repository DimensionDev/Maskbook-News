Mask Network will partner with DoinGud, the NFT marketplace for social impact, to allow seamless access to traditional Web 2.0 social platforms. It will allow creators to display their work while users could access their homepage and trade the work via Twitter at the same time.

Content producers online inevitably put a lot of effort into finding supporters aside from creating their work. Meanwhile, collectors and curators also put a lot of effort into finding the “perfect” work. Traditional social networks (e.g. Twitter) facilitate people to find each other, but the operation of building connections to further commercial gains for both parties is difficult to achieve on traditional social networks and has to be taken place on new platforms.

As an open source Web 3.0 application, Mask Network has been trying to build a bridge between the existing Internet Web 2.0 and the new, open Web 3.0, with the hope of bringing more great Web 3.0 applications to traditional social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Mask extension can save users a lot of tedious steps, allowing content creation-related practitioners to showcase and trade their work as NFTs while interacting with their peers and supporters on the traditional social media platforms they are familiar with.

This partnership is significant for creators and others: with the help of Mask Network, DoinGud will take DApplet development a step further, empowering creators, collectors, and social impact organizations that use DoinGud. You don’t have to be an expert in the technology or learn the logic of using a new platform, you can experience the magic of Web 3.0 in a familiar interface. Meanwhile, the partnership also enriches the NFT-related content options for Mask plugin users and allows more people to get to know talented creators.

Mask Network and DoinGud both believe that technology is supposed to play the role of empowering people and serving people. Any online community is constituted by people and should be people-centric, autonomous, self-governing, and self-sustaining.

Manuel Gonzalez Alzuru, the founder of DoinGud said: “As we build our NFT platform to bring together creators, curators, collectors, and social impact organizations, we are laser-focused on providing our community with tools that will make access to the NFT world easier than ever. Mask Network’s solution of bringing web3 solutions to traditional social media is a natural choice for DoinGud and the vast community we are striving to serve.”

We welcome all creators to join the community and our discussion and bring new interesting thoughts. Please also stay tuned to “DIVE NFT Adoption,” our latest Clubhouse talk.

**About Mask Network**

Mask Network is the core product of Dimension, which is positioned to become the bridge that connects internet users from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. The foundational technology of Mask Network is a peer-to-peer encrypted messaging application, with new functions continuously being created around this foundation. We at Mask Network are strong believers in the ownership economy. People should own what they produce, people should own their data, their attention and the virtual space they choose to contribute to.

Mask Network integrates decentralized social messaging, borderless payment network, decentralized file storage and sharing, decentralized finance, DAO and NFT to provide a safe and convenient portal for users to jump right into the continent of decentralized finance and then the new world of Web 3.0.
