* A total of 10,913,333 $MASK, 10.91% of the total supply will be circulating after the first month unlock (March, 2021) . 9% has been circulating for the first month. 1.91% will be released this time.
* Of the 1.91% released this time, 1.1% comes from the foundation, 0.81% comes from the investors. The foundation part, though unlocked, will still be held by us until further notice. So the effective unlock will only be 0.81%.
* Based on the current price of $MASK, the 0.81% newly released tokens are worth $11,340,000 (assume $14 per $MASK), which is less than 20% of the daily trading volume of $MASK.

Weâ€™ll keep updating the latest information about the $MASK token release, please stay tuned for our official announcements!
