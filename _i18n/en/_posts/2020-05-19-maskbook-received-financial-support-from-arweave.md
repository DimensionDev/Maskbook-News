In May 2020, Maskbook received the Financial Funding from Arweave, a new type of storage that backs data with sustainable and perpetual endowments.

In this cooperation, Maskbook will create a set of encryption schemes on Arweave. By using the Arweave's decentralization protocol, Maskbook aims to provide a secure platform for _collecting and storing the users’ Internet Data from access by others or organizations, and only the users themselves can access and control._

**What is Arweave？**

Arweave is a new type of storage that backs data with sustainable and perpetual endowments, allowing users and developers to truly store data forever – for the very first time.

As a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets, Arweave allows us to remember and preserve valuable information, apps, and history indefinitely. By preserving history, it prevents others from rewriting it.

Arweave has created a truly scalable infrastructure as a cornerstone of the data economy. Airwave is currently capable of 5,000 transactions per second.

Blockchain solves two fundamental problems of the current decentralized public chain:

* Restrictions on on-chain storage
* Unsustainable consensus mechanism

**What is Maskbook ？**

Maskbook is an open-source browser privacy plug-in that helps users automatically encrypt posts on social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Using Maskbook, social platforms can never review and misuse user data. Only the user and designated friends can decrypt.

**Personal Wayback Machine**

The aim of Maskbook & Arweave cooperation is to build a Personal Wayback Machine on the Arweave network. It’s a tool that can help users collect and store personal Internet tracking data and historical records. These data will be stored in a secure personal network database which only allows users to access and control.

User can use Maskbook plug-in to search their historical data on any platform, including posts, interactive information, and even private data such as personal diaries. Maskbook will provide users with a portal to access historical records stored on Arweave, and also provide a set of encryption schemes to protect the privacy of users' data.
