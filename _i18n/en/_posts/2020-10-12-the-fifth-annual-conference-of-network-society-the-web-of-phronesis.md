While capitalism seems to be generally frustrated with the global spread of the Covid-19, surveillance capitalism has secretly risen with the virus explosion. In the name of security, a centralized digital regime with unchallengeable legitimacy power is now strictly monitoring people, which seems to bring about an information centralized online society.

Aristotle indicates that the ‘phronesis’ (wisdom of praxis) produced by praxis can lead people to ‘aletheuein’ and to achieve the 'solicitous circumspection'. It means that there should be phronesis to manage the use of techne, so that the techne with major flaws in revealing the alethea (truth) but outside itself could be made the best use of. According to this, we assume that to take the thought (with action) as the starting point of the techne production would construct the future of humans under the Covid-19 state of emergency. We believe that the starting point would be able to trigger discussions that go beyond proliferation and concentration of global technology, therefore forks our futures.

In the previous Annual Conferences "Forces of Reticulation" (2016), "Another Walk with Lefebvre: Critique of Urbanism and Everyday Life in the Algorithmic Age" (2017), "Intelligent Urban Fabric" (2018) and "Neitizen21: Beyond Personal Account" (2019), INS connected worldwide scholars and activists to construct criticism toward current network society and explore a network of practices together. The fifth annual conference, the Web of Phronesis, tries to explore technical practices hindered by social dilemma, and to review the life of infinite branches created by love between we and the world along with imaginations.

**PANEL I: RADICAL MARKET**

**2020/10/20 Tuesday 18:30-21:30**

**VENUE**

Shanbei Gymnasium (BLD.8), Xiangshan Campus, China Academy of Art, Hangzhou

**MODERATOR**

Huang SunQuan & Liu Yihong

**COMMENTARY**

Liu yisi & Yan Suji

The global crises of declining productivity, economic stagnation, conflict and inequality are caused by the inherent predatory accumulation, monopoly, and inequitable distribution of capitalism, as well as the poor democratic mechanism, restrictions on labors and immigrants’ mobility. The “radical market” is a thought experiment seeks “radical change”, in order to plot the bottom-up economic, social, and informational technology plans of future, taking into account the allocation efficiency of the free market and investment incentives at the same time, and turning crisis into opportunities for the common good. What are the critical issues of the current crisis? How to strike a balance between a free economy and state economic intervention in long-term risk management? How does modern society deal with the associated risks that are positively correlated with its system complexity?

**KEYNOTE SPEAKERS**

Vitalik Buterin（Founder of Ethereum）

**WEST LAKE MESH NETWORK WORKSHOP**

2020/11/14─15 Saturday、Sunday 10：00-17：00

**CONVENOR**

DWeb Shanghai

**VENUE**

Room 405,408, BLD.4, Nanshan Campus, China Academy of Art

[_https://github.com/DWebShanghai/draft/blob/master/proj_west_lake.org_](https://github.com/DWebShanghai/draft/blob/master/proj_west_lake.org "https://github.com/DWebShanghai/draft/blob/master/proj_west_lake.org")

How could we keep in touch without commercial internets? With technical supports of dWeb Shanghai, attandees of the workshop will try to set up wireless internet in groups at Building 4, Nanshan Campus, China Academy of Art. In this two-day workshop, participants are going to install the equipments on Day1, then design and set up the internet on Day 2. Like an utopia, this wireless network should be able to get accessed by all people in Nanshan campus until the end of the fifth annual conference. It will be the first experiment of setting up Mesh Network around the West Lake, Hangzhou, in China.

The mesh network will be come a platform recording the weather of participants' locations such as the temperature, the humidity and qualities of the air, with no need to pay for the internet provided by ISP.

The DIY of mesh network all around the world is updating knowledge about the 'communities', the 'sharing' and the 'nearby'.

Freifunk in Germany covers over 400 wireless communities; B4RN in Lancasire is now serving UK government with optical fiber. As a community network, the coverage of guifi.net in Europe is probably the widest. Tens of thousands of Spanish people including volunteers, non-profit organizations, public management organizations and media companies are served by this network.

A non-profit organization in the rural area at Mount Olympus in Greece, Sarantaporo, have been established for saving the community from financial crisis in 2010 by local youths since 2013. The wireless mesh network they DIY'ed is now serving over 5000 residents in more than 10 villages. People exchanges views and goods on the applications, which help the organization won the European BroadbandAwards in 2019. FFDN in France is a combination of community networks.

All the mesh networks are distinguished from the others. The networks are covering not only urban areas, but also rural areas, slums and immigrants communities. The motivations to set up the mesh networks are different, whereas all the networks could be defined as decentralized webs. The webs belong to users rather than commercial internet service providers, they liberates individuals from digital oligarchy and empower the autonomy of users.

**YOUTH ROUND TABLE**

2020/11/20 Friday 10：30-17：00

**VENUE**

Nanyuan Auditorium, 1F Building 4, Nanshan Campus, China Academy of Art

The Web of Phronesis focuses on not only praxis, but also theories. To architect a better future, we try to review the intelligence and experiences gained by technology using. In addition to a workshop and four panels, we called for papers from young scholars and people with faiths all around the world, holding the Youth Round Table. In this session, there will be ten presentations from the scholars carefully evaluated and selected by the committee. Selectees are going to present on the spot, discussing with each others and expand their practice and thinking from the philosophical, artistic, socialized and technical levels.

**PANEL II: INTERNET ARCHIVE**

2020/11/20 Friday 18：30-21：30

**VENUE**

The truths history narrates could always be footnotes to the facts. They are quarantined by the reality of the time. Since the establishment of the Internet Archive in 1996, information generated by the Internet has far exceeded the total amount of human history. Today, digitized files and metadata records have become the main issue of art museums and galleries. Under this circumstance, to preserve, to record and to file human civilization are critical challenges to technicalize and to externalize human history.

The 'archive' is accumulation of documents cataloged by authorities. Under this circumstance, it is the method to catalog, operated by archivists, made up the narrative of human history.

The automatic digital archives are now saving the hidden and the deleted to photoelectric media. Under this circumstance, human civilization resists the absence, which means ideologies and bias on cultures can do nothing to question recorded truths, and people have no power are not allowed to correct or even to simply write a history. The shared root of modernology and archaeology found that there is no authorities presently but only searching algorithm and the metadata in our age. It seems like we are living in a time without archivist.

**MODERATOR**

Huang SunQuan

Should Internets owned by oligarchs? How to create Internet in which inclusive love could stand, publicness would be compatible with privacy, and everyone would be welcomed? When decentralizing, people are exploring the relationship between networks and human society rather than simply updating technologies. Decentralizing is not for the sake of decentralization, but for benefiting human societies, to decreased harms and inconveniences that digital orligarchy have made. Decentralized internets should be open to all the people, because that is what Internet was originally made for. In this panel, practitioners of Decentralized Web will be invited to share their experiences on architecting in the atlas of the future has already taken place.

**VENUE**

Nanyuan Auditorium, 1F Building 4, Nanshan Campus, China Academy of Art

**MODERATOR**

Huang SunQuan & Liu Yisi

Although to ensure one’s privacy and security on the internet are basic human rights, the monopoly and the algorithmic improvement of social media are now preventing the netizens from seizing back their lost human rights. To retake online privacy and security needs revolutions on both economy and society.

Gladly we found that there are plenty of technologies prepared for this revolution have progressed substantially in the past decade, including public key encryption, end-to-end encryption, zero-knowledge proof, and plenty of software protocols that are used in interactions, authentications and verification. We are aiming to achieve the ultimate possibilities within the existing social system.
