Mask Network is collaborating with Cent through a joint bounty to add NFTs directly to Twitter: bid and trade on tweets directly within Twitter to support those who tweet!

Bounty link:[ ](https://github.com/DimensionDev/Maskbook/issues/2599)[https://gitcoin.co/issue/DimensionDev/Maskbook/2599](https://gitcoin.co/issue/DimensionDev/Maskbook/2599 "https://gitcoin.co/issue/DimensionDev/Maskbook/2599")

With support from Valuables, the tweet minting platform made by Cent, Mask Network aims to enable users to trade tweets as NFTs directly on Twitter, and in the near future, allows an instant look into the tweet's bidding history. When a user feels a connection to a particular tweet, or wants to support the person/organization that created the tweet, they can now bid on an NFT of that tweet, directly within Twitter.

Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and CEO of Twitter, had listed his very first tweet for sale as an NFT on Valuables. The sale ended on March 21st, and the tweet was sold for over $2.9 million USD. All profits were converted into Bitcoin and donated to the charity GiveDirectly’s Africa response.

What does it mean to "own" a tweet?

The tweet itself will continue to live on Twitter. What users purchased is a digital certificate of the tweet, unique and signed by the creator using cryptography. Apart from the digital signature from the creator's crypto wallet address, the digital certificate includes metadata of the original tweet: who posted it, when it was posted, the contents of the tweet, and more. All metadata lives on the Matic blockchain. Users could do whatever they want with the tweet they own: resell them on Valuables or display them in your online gallery.

Content creators on Twitter will be able to trade tweets using the Mask Network extension, and see value in the tweets they create. Everything takes place on Twitter directly, so there's no need to navigate out of the native twitter experience.

Mask Network did some experiments within the NFT field: During last year's US election, Mask Network posted 589 "US Election Special Edition NFTs" on its official Twitter account. We also embedded a "Collectibles" feature into the "Dashboard," where users could check the art pieces they own as NFTs directly.

In the near future, Mask Network will carry on developing new features for NFTs, making it easier to create, collect, and trade NFTs on centralized platforms (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram…). Now that concepts such as NFTs and Web 3.0 are becoming better known, Mask Network hopes to accelerate adoption and welcome more users to the benefits.

We at Mask Network believe NFTs represent more than tweets or digital art. In the future, multi-category NFTs will form a new on-chain e-commerce world; the products and applications we see now are only the tip of the iceberg. Mask Network shares a similar vision with Cent, which is to be the platform for creators to showcase their work, to bring context to NFTs in many forms, and to let users reclaim the ownership of their digital identities.

**About Cent / Valuables**

Cent is a platform powered by digital identity. Cent provides tools for those who create, curate, and collaborate for a living, replacing the traditional info feed with an immersive gallery. Those who support the gallery form a community, generate income for creators. Content creators could display their own gallery to the community, or license their work to another gallery and distribute within the community.

Cent believes that digital identity carries three principles: yours, forever, and interoperable. All activities a user generated (text, picture, videos, interactions...) solely belong to the user and collaborators. Users should hold control with where content appears, how personal data are used, and most importantly, how it is monetized. Every record of ownership is kept in an encrypted digital storage that is maintained on a public network, users will have access at all times. Their digital identity doesn't depend on any single platform. Users are free to create identity on any of the existing (and upcoming) networks, and transfer freely between them.

**About Mask Network**

Mask Network is the core product of Dimension, which is positioned to become the bridge that connects internet users from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. The foundational technology of Mask Network is a peer to peer encrypted messaging application, with new functions continuously being created around this foundation. We at Mask Network are strong believers in the ownership economy. People should own what they produce, people should own their data, their attention and the virtual space they choose to contribute to.

Mask Network integrates decentralized social messaging, borderless payment network, and decentralized file storage and sharing to provide a safe and convenient portal for users to jump right into the continent of decentralized finance and then the new world of Web 3.0.
