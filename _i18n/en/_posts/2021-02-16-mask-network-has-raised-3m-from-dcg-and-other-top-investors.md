The new round of financing was built on an outstanding year for Mask Network, which saw an accelerated execution of an ambitious roadmap including DeFi integration, decentralized storage, fiat-on-ramp, etc. Since its launch in 2017, Mask Network has evolved and developed the product extensively and has grown into a portal to an open and decentralized Internet for billions of existing social media users. The close of funding comes on the heels of another notable development: Mask Network will launch **$MASK**, the governance token of Mask Network. The unveiling of **$MASK** will be implemented in our exclusive format: Initial Twitter Offering, with airdrops to our users and supporters.

_More details will be released within 1 day._

“In 2020, we’ve finished the core of Mask Network and has been partnering with more and more great projects (such as MakerDAO, Uniswap, CMC, Loopring, Solana, NEAR Protocol) for a decentralized and open web. We also supported many other web decentralization efforts, such as Mastodon. The fund raised in this round will be used to further grow our developer community and further refine our social + finance approaches to bringing together Web 2.0 and Web 3.0.” said Suji Yan, founder & CEO of Mask Network.

“Mask is taking a unique approach to bringing Web3 applications to some of the largest social networks. We’re excited about its potential to foster greater levels of decentralization, censorship resistance, and monetization methods for its users.” said Matt Beck, Director of Investments at DCG.

With the solid backing of both capital and years of proprietary technology development, we will not fail the expectations of our community. Mask Network will continue to partner with top ecosystem players in DApp integration and introduce more innovative and much-needed features, all to bridge the gap between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 for netizens.
