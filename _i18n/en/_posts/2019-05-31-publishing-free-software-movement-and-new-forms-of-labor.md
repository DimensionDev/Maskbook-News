On May 31, 2019, Suji Yan and Katt Gu published a paper called **_The Free Software Movement and the New Form of Labor_** on RadicalxChange. The content is about the phenomenon of 996 working systems in many technology industries in China today. Therefore, some people established the 996.icu website to arouse a lot of public opinions, combined with the concept of "**Data is labor**" in **_Radical Markets_**, and proposed that "**user production data equals a new form of labor**."

On March 24 this year, Suji Yan received an invitation from E. Glen Weyl to travel to Detroit, Michigan for the RadicalxChange conference. RadicalxChange aims to jointly build a new alternative solution to solve the most divisive problems in society. It has brought together many artists, scholars, entrepreneurs, etc. who are paying attention to various issues in society to fight for a brighter future.

The world is hovering at a crossroads. Society and the economy are experiencing unprecedented challenges. The gap between the wealth class is widening, economic development is stagnating, and world politics are treacherous. The Internet's 996 and the Sino-US trade war have more or less reflected the root causes of the above contradictions. Born from rigorous social science, RadicalxChange came into being, embracing markets, technology, communities, and diversity.

Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum (ETH), is also one of the co-sponsors of RadicalxChange, who once stated at the conference that "**today's cryptocurrency advocates and developers should get rid of the fierce individualism of the crypto-punk movement and get rid of excessive Focus on maximizing autonomy and privacy.** "The idea is to use technology to create new, fair and innovative systems with positive social impact.

This time Suji Yan and Katt Gu were invited by E. Glen Weyl to write this article, hoping to attract the attention of many Internet practitioners and propose a new form of labor.

E. Glen Weyl is the author of Radical Markets. He believes that the way out of the deadlock in liberalism is to expand the market, rather than weaken its role. Some concepts of liberalism, such as those on intellectual property rights, elections, and immigration, are impractical, and some are even outrageous. However, when facing the challenges brought by populism and protectionism, it may be pointed out A response.

Radical Markets was named the Economist's Recommended Book of the Year in 2018. The starting point for this book is a series of new challenges in today's world despite the global economic growth in recent decades, the gap between countries It is shrinking, but inequality within the country is increasing, and social and political divisions and divisions are becoming increasingly serious-the liberal market economy that once made the Western world proud, especially the United States, is facing an unprecedented crisis.

Change is imminent, but better alternatives than centrally planned economies have yet to emerge. Fortunately, today's technological advances, especially the rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies in the context of big data, are quietly redefining social and production relationships. To a certain extent, this makes a feasible institutional design, which might sound unrealistic decades ago. Now, with the help of new technologies, difficult problems can break through institutional barriers and have solutions.
