We’re thrilled that our ITO feature is so well received after its release within a month! In our last ITO with Loopring, \~$50000 worth of $LRC was sold out in less than 3 minutes. Now, we are ready to announce our second ITO project: **$mTSLA**！

In light of recent events involving WallStreetBets, Robinhood and Elon Musk, which grabbed everyone’s attention throughout the world, [Mask Network](http://mask.io/), together with [Mirror Protocol](http://mirror.finance/), [OKEx](http://okex.com/),[Transak](http://transak%2Ccom/) are excited to offer $**mTSLA** on Twitter. The ITO will grant exposure to the power of Mirrored Assets (mAssets) to a social media audience anxiously anticipating an alternative to conventional trading apps like Robinhood.

Permissionless for users worldwide, synthetic assets, censorship-resistent— all inside Mask and without leaving Twitter. With Tesla stock among the most popular equities for young traders and Twitter memes, it serves as a fitting inaugural ITO choice for mAssets.

The ITO for **$mTSLA** will enable its users to directly purchase **$mTSLA** using **$wBTC**, **$UST** or **$OKB** via Mask Network plug-in on Twitter. The total offering will be 100 shares of **$mTSLA** (\~$80K) at a 10% discount. ITO participants are limited to 1 $mTSLA per address.

The ITO will officially begin on **02/03/21 at 1 PM EST — New York** (**02/04/21 at 2 AM CST — Beijing**). Mirror will provide the direct link to the ITO just prior to the launch.

As Elon Musk said earlier, “**In hindsight, it was inevitable.”** Mask Network is looking forward to engaging with Mirror further about avenues to bring more mAssets to the Twitter world — giving financially disenfranchised users access to macro asset classes via permissionless technology.

Mask Network’s Twitter Offering is a brand-new way of token issuance and swapping. Its permissionless nature allows anyone to launch offerings at any time without leaving Twitter. You can also create an ITO of your own. We look forward to seeing more individuals and projects to join us and enjoy offering your token directly on Twitter!
